        <p class="mt-4">
          As a passionate Frontend Developer, I am always looking for new
          opportunities to learn and improve. Currently, I am focusing on
          TypeScript and deepening my knowledge of React.js and Redux.js.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          In addition to my studies at the University of Lorraine, I have taken
          several online courses to develop my web development skills. I have
          also completed several personal projects, including a sneaker
          reselling website using React and an interactive mobile app for
          exploring the points of interest in Metz using React Cordova.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          I am currently in my final year of study at the University of Lorraine
          and I am eager to put my knowledge into practice and tackle new
          professional challenges.
